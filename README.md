### Presentation Description

There are many opinions and techniques for reviewing code. Instead
of boring you to death with another philosophical rant, we will
explore what not to say to your co-workers through examples. Once
our journey is complete, we will have tools to help recognize these
non-constructive behaviors before hitting send. Areas of interest
will include team trust and safety, active and passive aggression,
and creativity blockers.
